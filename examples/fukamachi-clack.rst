wookie_empty_body
-----------------

Specify an empty body for NIL bodies.

Wookie's docs for SEND-RESPONSE specify that it sets
Content-Length if the :body argument is specified, so we should
pass it for explicitly supplied bodies that are NIL. Without
it, Content-Length won't be set and the browser will hang
waiting for the connection to close.
